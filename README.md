The Digital Agency Package is a collection of features and configuration tailored to 
meet the needs of a digital agency, artist, or other organization that provides various
services that need to be showcased on their website and requires a portfolio.

This package is the glue that pulls together and binds several existing recipes that 
will create content types, views, and content. 

This project was conceived as a package of content and configuration to be supported
by the [Zeever theme](https://github.com/stpaultim/zeever/wiki). The Zeever theme is being developed with this package of content
and configuration in mind. However, we choose a different name for this project to 
reflect the fact, that more than one theme might choose to support this package.

At this stage, we're discussing this package of content and configuration in the Zeever
issue queue, because of our development process. This is a temporary workflow, until 
we launch the Zeever theme.
