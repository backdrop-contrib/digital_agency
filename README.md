The Digital Agency Package is a collection of features and configuration tailored to 
meet the needs of a digital agency, artist, or other organization that provides various
services that need to be showcased on their website and requires a portfolio.

This package is the glue that pulls together and binds several existing recipes that 
will create content types, views, and content. 

This project was conceived as a package of content and configuration to be supported
by the [Zeever theme](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/zeever/wiki). The Zeever theme is being developed with this package of content
and configuration in mind. However, we choose a different name for this project to 
reflect the fact, that more than one theme might choose to support this package.
